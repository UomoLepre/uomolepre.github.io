# Multimodal Garment Designer Webapp

Model Garment Design (MGD) is a demo project powered by a multi-modal artificial intelligence, developed using Stable Diffusion technology. The primary goal of MGD is to facilitate the design and creation of garments through a user web interface.
As in many industries, the fashion world is increasingly embracing artificial intelligence to streamline processes. MGD aims to assist designers in accelerating the creation of garments by offering an initial concept through a combination of sketches and brief descriptions, providing a quick first impression of the design.
